app.rb is a minigame in which a duck, josiane, and a dog, jos√©, fight.
It was made as an exercise in OOP for THP in 2020, 14th session.
The contestants start out with 10 lives and dish out randomized damage until one of them is out cold.

A second and third game were not completed and sanity was preserved :)
